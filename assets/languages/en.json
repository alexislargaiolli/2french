"faq.teacher.2.question" : "What is the calendar for and how do I use it?",
"faq.teacher.2.awnser" : "<p>When a student clicks on your profile, he can immediately view your availabilities on the calendar. Which is why we recommend to regularly update your calendar.</p><p>To access your calendar, you only need to log in and from your dashboard you can modify your availability. You can also choose exactly the days, weeks, months when you want to offer your lessons. </p>",
"faq.teacher.3.question" : "How do I calculate a fair price for my classes?",
"faq.teacher.3.awnser" : "<p>You are free to propose the rate of your choice. But to give you an idea of going rates, you can for example look at similar offers in your city or region.</p><p>However, we do ask you to propose fair rates that are in line with your services. We advise you for example not to propose rates that are too low, that is to say less than the going hourly-rate for your profession.</p><p>For courses that are more complex (cultural outings, accommodation, courses lasting for several weeks, etc.) you can propose a flat rate or give a detailed breakdown of the price. </p>",
"faq.teacher.4.question" : "Can the student ask me for an invoice?",
"faq.teacher.4.awnser" : "<p>Yes, since the student and the teacher are the only two parties involved, you can send them an invoice for the total amount of the formation if they ask for it. </p><p>You can find invoice templates on the site <a href='http://www.lautoentrepreneur.fr' target='_blank'>www.lautoentrepreneur.fr</a>.</p><p>Be aware that this template is valid only in France. You must conform with the laws and regulations of the country in which you propose your classes.</p>",
"faq.teacher.5.question" : "Can I cancel a confirmed class?",
"faq.teacher.5.awnser" : "<p>In principle, no, however it may be that you are unable to remain committed to a class for your own reasons.</p><p>In this case, contact the student as soon as possible and arrange any possible solutions directly with them.</p>",
"faq.teacher.6.question" : "How and when am I paid?",
"faq.teacher.6.awnser" : "<p>Payment methods and schedule are for you and the student to decide. TooFrench is not involved in the payment process. </p>",

"faq.teacher.8.question" : "Do I have to accept every request?",
"faq.teacher.8.awnser" : "<p>Absolutely not. The decision is always yours and it is only your responsibility to accept or decline requests. </p>",
"faq.teacher.9.question" : "Where are the courses held?",
"faq.teacher.9.awnser" : "<p>You and the student decide where classes are held. They can be at your place or anywhere you want.</p>",
"faq.teacher.10.question" : "What activities can I propose?",
"faq.teacher.10.awnser" : "<p>You are free to propose any activities you like, depending on your interests and desires.</p><p>We strongly encourage you to be creative. For example, you could propose to discover your city or your region, to visit well-known sites or hidden treasures only locals know. You can also propose athletic, culinary, and cultural activities. Really anything you feel like sharing!</p>",

"faq.student.1.question" : "Where are classes held?",
"faq.student.1.awnser" : "<p>You and your teacher decide where your classes will be held. </p><p>Certain teachers can offer you classes at home (theirs or yours), others can offer you courses in a classroom, outside, or place that seems appropriate to you.</p>",
"faq.student.2.question" : "Cultural activities?",
"faq.student.2.awnser" : "<p>There are some extra-curricular activities that the teacher can offer you. They could include wine tastings, sampling local products, athletic activities, cultural outings, etc.</p><p>These activities should allow you to practice the language in a non-academic setting while allowing you to discover the culture of the city of your choice.</p>",
"faq.student.3.question" : "How and when do I need to pay for my classes?",
"faq.student.3.awnser" : "<p>TooFrench n’intervient pas dans le paiement, il vous appartient donc de décider, en accord avec votre enseignant, des modalités du paiement. TooFrench is not involved with any aspect of the payment process, you need to arrange payment methods directly with your teacher.</p>",
"faq.student.4.question" : "Can I cancel my class?",
"faq.student.4.awnser" : "<p>It may be that you are no longer able to attend your courses for personal reasons. In this case, you should contact your teacher and cancel your reservation.</p>",

After our experiences teaching abroad and in France, we are committed to finding the best solutions for both students and teachers.</p><p>So we thought about helping people to get directly in touch with each other so that everyone can find what they want, at the right price, with the right working and studying conditions, according to their interests and preferred methods.</p><p>The concept is simple: the teacher proposes the classes he wants to teach, the student chooses the class that he wants according to his location and linguistic needs. TooFrench allows students to contact teachers to adapt the classes according to their availability and expectations.</p><p>It’s our goal to unite the maximum number of teachers with the maximum number of students in France and around the world and to become an international, diverse, and personalized platform for French language education </p><p>The quality of your experience is guaranteed because every teacher’s diplomas are verified by the TooFrench team.
